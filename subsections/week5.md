## **2. Ribosome Biogenesis**

### **2.1 What is Ribosome Biogenesis?**

* The process of **ribosome assembly** from ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins.
* Takes place in the **nucleolus** and involves:
  * **rRNA transcription, processing, and folding** .
  * Binding of  **ribosomal proteins** .
  * Export of assembled ribosomal subunits to the cytoplasm.

### **2.2 Key Molecular Components**

* **rRNAs** : Structural and catalytic RNA molecules (18S, 28S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNA in eukaryotes).
* **Ribosomal Proteins** : Stabilize rRNA and form the ribosomeâ€™s structural framework.
* **Assembly Factors** : Chaperones and helicases that ensure proper rRNA folding.

### **2.3 Simulation Studies**

* MD simulations help study:
  * **Subunit interactions** : Between the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunits.
  * **RNA-protein binding stability** .
  * **RNA folding pathways** during ribosome assembly.

### **Resources for Ribosome Studies** :

* **PDB Structures** : 3D structures of ribosomal subunits ([https://www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/)).
* **Cryo-EM Data** : Detailed ribosomal structures at various assembly stages ([EMDB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb)).
