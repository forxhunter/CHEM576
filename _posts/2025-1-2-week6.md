### **1. Systems Biology Overview**

* **Systems biology** focuses on understanding how molecular components (genes, proteins, metabolites) interact to form complex biological systems.
* **Key Concepts** :
* **Metabolic Networks** : Pathways describing the transformation of substrates into products via enzymatic reactions.
* **Steady-State Analysis** : Involves determining the flow of metabolites through these networks when the system is in equilibrium.

### **2. Breuer et al. (eLife, 2019)**

 **Paper URL** : [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34598](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34598)

* **Title** : "Essential metabolism for a minimal cell."
* **Key Findings** :
* Developed a model of a minimal synthetic cell with only the essential metabolic pathways required for survival.
* Used a constraint-based modeling approach to reconstruct the minimal genome-derived metabolic network.
* Demonstrated that even in minimal cells, complex interactions exist between metabolism and gene expression.

## **Week 8: Whole Cell Kinetic Modeling and Simulations**

---

### **1. Overview of Whole-Cell Modeling**

Whole-cell modeling aims to simulate every process occurring inside a cell, including:

* **Gene Expression** : Transcription and translation of genes into proteins.
* **Metabolism** : Conversion of nutrients into energy and biomass.
* **Coupling Mechanisms** : Interactions between gene expression, metabolic fluxes, and cellular growth.

---

### **2. Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation (RDME)**

* **Purpose** : Models biochemical reactions in a spatially resolved system.
* **Key Concepts** :
* **Stochastic Reactions** : Random reaction events occur based on reaction propensities.
* **Diffusion** : Molecules diffuse between compartments, influencing spatial gradients.

---

### **3. Lattice Microbes (LM)**

 **URL** : [https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/lm](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/lm)

* **Purpose** : A GPU-accelerated software package for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion systems.
* **Key Features** :
* Simulates RDME for large-scale cellular processes.
* Optimized for parallel computation on GPUs.
* Tracks molecular trajectories and reactions over time.
* **Tutorial** : Official tutorials available at [Lattice Microbes Documentation](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/lm).

### **4. Jupyter Python Notebook**

 **URL** : [https://jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/)

* **Purpose** : An interactive computing environment for writing and running Python scripts.
* **Key Use Cases** :
* Combine with Lattice Microbes for  **interactive simulations** .
* Plot simulation results and analyze system kinetics.
* **Example** :

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
time = [0, 10, 20, 30]
concentration = [0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2]
plt.plot(time, concentration)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Concentration (mM)")
plt.show()
```

### **5. Machine Learning for Kinetic Parameter Estimation**

* **Problem** : Kinetic parameters (e.g., reaction rates) are often unknown or difficult to measure experimentally.
* **Solution** :
* **Machine Learning (ML)** : Train models using experimental data to estimate unknown parameters.
* Example approaches:
  * **Neural Networks** : Predict rate constants based on known system behaviors.
  * **Bayesian Inference** : Probabilistic estimation of parameter distributions.
