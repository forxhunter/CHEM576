## **1. Overview of Subcellular Networks**

Subcellular networks describe the **DNA replication, transcription, and translation machinery** in cells. Understanding these networks in a **minimal cell** (synthetic cell with the simplest genome) helps model the core processes of life.

## **2. Stochastic Gene Expression**

* **Stochasticity** : Biological processes at the molecular level (e.g., transcription, translation) are subject to random fluctuations due to the low copy numbers of molecules.
* **Key Concepts** :
* **Bursting Transcription** : RNA production occurs in bursts rather than continuously.
* **Noise in Gene Expression** : Variability in mRNA and protein levels due to stochastic processes.
