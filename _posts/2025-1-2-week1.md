### **1.2 SWISSPROT/UniprotKB**

 **URL** : [https://www.uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org/) (part of UniProt)

SWISS-PROT, now commonly referred to as the **Swiss-Prot** database, is a **manually curated** database of protein sequences that provides **high-quality annotations** about proteins. It forms a core part of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), which is one of the most widely used resources in proteomics and bioinformatics.

* **High-Quality, Reviewed Entries:**

  * Each protein entry in Swiss-Prot is reviewed manually by biocurators who verify the sequence and provide detailed functional annotations.
  * Annotations may include protein names, function, subcellular location, biological pathways, interactions, and post-translational modifications (PTMs).
* **Experimental Validation**:

  * Swiss-Prot prioritizes data derived from experimental evidence (e.g., mass spectrometry, crystallography) to ensure that the annotations are based on proven results rather than computational predictions alone.
* **Low Redundancy:**

  * Efforts are made to avoid duplicate entries, ensuring that only unique sequences with biologically relevant differences are stored.
* **Consistent Nomenclature and Controlled Vocabulary:**

  * Swiss-Prot ensures that protein names and descriptions are standardized and follow controlled vocabulary to avoid confusion.

#### **Relationship Between Swiss-Prot and UniProt**

## **2. Deep Learning Neural Networks (NN)**

### **2.1Neural Networks (NNs)** :

Deep learning architectures for biological sequence and structure analysis.

Typical layers:

* **Input Layer** : Takes biological sequence data (DNA/protein sequences).
* **Hidden Layers** : Perform computations using activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid).
* **Output Layer** : Predicts properties (e.g., structure, binding sites).

### **2.2Example Applications** :

#### **[AlphaFold3](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/)** : Predicts protein structures from sequences.

AlphaFold 3, developed by Isomorphic Labs Limited (London, United Kingdom) and Google DeepMind, represents a significant leap forward in the field of molecular biology through its ability to predict the structure and interactions of biomolecules with unparalleled accuracy. This revolutionary model extends its predictive capabilities beyond proteins to encompass a broad spectrum of biomolecules, **including proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands**, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the biological world.

* **The Evoformer in AF2/AF3** is based on a **transformer-like neural network** that takes in two main representations:

  1. **MSA Representation (multiple sequence alignment)** – captures evolutionary conservation patterns across homologous sequences.
  2. **Pair Representation (pairwise distances)** – models spatial relationships between amino acids in the sequence.

  The Evoformer learns how amino acids interact within a protein sequence and how these interactions evolve across homologous sequences by applying attention and mixing operations to the MSA and pair representations.
* **Diffusion Module(AF3 only):** AF3 utilizes a diffusion model to generate predicted protein structures by progressively refining a noisy initial representation of atomic coordinates= , essentially "denoising" the data to arrive at a final, accurate protein structure; it replaces the previous "Structure module" used in AlphaFold 2

![AF3](../assets/images/2025-1-2-week1/alphafold3.webp)

AF3 is pubicly available in the github repository: [google-deepmind/alphafold3: AlphaFold 3 inference pipeline.](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) The model parameters have to be requested from Google DeepMind by [this form](https://forms.gle/svvpY4u2jsHEwWYS6) and subject to [terms of use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).

## **3. Sequence/Structure Alignment Algorithms**

### 3.1. **Sequence Alignment**

Sequence alignment is the process of arranging the sequences of nucleotides (DNA or RNA) or amino acids (proteins) to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of structural, functional, or evolutionary relationships.

Formally, given two sequences $A = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m) $ and $B = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) $ over an alphabet (e.g., $\Sigma = \{A, C, G, T\}$ for nucleotides or 20 amino acids for proteins), a sequence alignment is a set of pairs of indices $(i, j) $ such that:

* Each index $i$ corresponds to a character in $A$, and $j$ corresponds to a character in $B$.
* Each character can appear in at most one pair in the alignment.
* The order is preserved: If $(i, j)$ and $(i', j')$ are pairs in the alignment and $i < i'$, then $j < j'$.

#### 3.1.1Scoring Function:

The alignment is evaluated based on a scoring function $S(A, B)$, which typically includes:

* $\delta(a_i, b_j)$: A substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM or PAM for proteins) that assigns a score to matching or mismatching pairs.
* $g(k)$: A gap penalty function that penalizes insertions or deletions in the sequence.

The optimal alignment maximizes the score:

$$
\text{Score} = \sum_{(i,j) \in \text{alignment}} \delta(a_i, b_j) - \sum_{\text{gaps}} g(k)
$$

Types of Sequence Alignments:

* **Global alignment** (e.g., Needleman-Wunsch): Aligns the entire length of both sequences.
* **Local alignment** (e.g., Smith-Waterman): Identifies the highest-scoring subsequences.

#### 3.1.2 Global Alighment(Needleman-Wunsch) Algorithm

##### Definitions:

- Let $A = a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$ and $B = b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ be two sequences of length $m$ and $n$.
- Define $S(i, j)$ as the **alignment score** of sequences $A$ and $B$ up to $i$\-th and $j$\-th elements, respectively.
- Let:
  - $\text{match}(a_i, b_j)$ = score for matching $a_i$ and $b_j$,
  - $\text{mismatch penalty} = -\mu$,
  - $\text{gap penalty} = -\delta$ for inserting a gap.

**Recursive Formula for the Score Matrix $S(i, j)$:**

$S(i, j) = \max \begin{cases} S(i - 1, j - 1) + \text{score}(a_i, b_j) & \text{(diagonal: match/mismatch)} \\ S(i - 1, j) - \delta & \text{(vertical: gap in sequence B)} \\ S(i, j - 1) - \delta & \text{(horizontal: gap in sequence A)} \end{cases}$

**Boundary Conditions:**

$S(0, 0) = 0, \quad S(i, 0) = -i \cdot \delta, \quad S(0, j) = -j \cdot \delta$

This initializes the first row and column to reflect the cost of gaps.

---

##### **Step-by-Step Example**

- Sequence $A = \text{"GATT"}$
- Sequence $B = \text{"GCTA"}$
- Scoring:

  - Match = $+1$,
  - Mismatch = $-1$,
  - Gap penalty $\delta = -2$.

**Step 1: Initialization of the Matrix**

We create a matrix $S(i, j)$ of size $(m + 1) \times (n + 1)$, initialized as follows:

$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c} & - & G & C & T & A \\ \hline - & 0 & -2 & -4 & -6 & -8 \\ G & -2 & & & & \\ A & -4 & & & & \\ T & -6 & & & & \\ T & -8 & & & & \\ \end{array}$

**Step 2: Filling the Matrix**

We compute the values using the recursive formula:

1. **Cell (1, 1): $S(1, 1)$**

   - Sequence positions: $A[1] = \text{G}, B[1] = \text{G}$
   - $\text{match}(G, G) = +1$

   $S(1, 1) = \max \begin{cases} S(0, 0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \quad \text{(match)} \\ S(0, 1) - 2 = -2 - 2 = -4 \quad \text{(gap in A)} \\ S(1, 0) - 2 = -2 - 2 = -4 \quad \text{(gap in B)} \end{cases} = 1$
2. **Cell (1, 2): $S(1, 2)$**

   - Sequence positions: $A[1] = \text{G}, B[2] = \text{C}$
   - $\text{mismatch penalty} = -1$

   $S(1, 2) = \max \begin{cases} S(0, 1) - 1 = -2 - 1 = -3 \quad \text{(mismatch)} \\ S(0, 2) - 2 = -4 - 2 = -6 \quad \text{(gap in A)} \\ S(1, 1) - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1 \quad \text{(gap in B)} \end{cases} = -1$
3. **Continue filling the rest of the matrix similarly.**

**Final Score Matrix:**

$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c} & - & G & C & T & A \\ \hline - & 0 & -2 & -4 & -6 & -8 \\ G & -2 & 1 & -1 & -3 & -5 \\ A & -4 & -1 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\ T & -6 & -3 & -2 & 1 & -1 \\ T & -8 & -5 & -4 & -1 & 0 \\ \end{array}$

---

**Step 3: Traceback**

To get the optimal alignment, we start from $S(m, n)$ and trace backward:

1. If $S(i, j) = S(i - 1, j - 1) + \text{score}(a_i, b_j)$, align $a_i$ with $b_j$.
2. If $S(i, j) = S(i - 1, j) - \delta$, align $a_i$ with a gap.
3. If $S(i, j) = S(i, j - 1) - \delta$, align $b_j$ with a gap.

For this example:

- $G$ aligns with $G$,
- Gap inserted in $A$ at position 2,
- $T$ aligns with $T$,
- $T$ aligns with gap.

**Final Alignment:**

```python
G A - T T
G - C T A
```

---

#### **3.1.3 Local Alighment/Smith-Waterman Algorithm**

The **local alignment algorithm** is used to find the optimal subsequence alignment between two sequences by maximizing the alignment score in a subregion rather than over the entire sequences.

##### Definition

Let $A = a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$ and $B = b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ be two sequences of lengths $m$ and $n$, respectively. Intialize the scoring matrix with:

$$
H(i, 0)= 0; H(0,j)=0
$$

The local alignment algorithm computes an **alignment score matrix** $H(i, j)$ with the following recurrence relation:

$$
H(i, j) = \max \begin{cases} 0, \\ H(i-1, j-1) + S(a_i, b_j), & \text{(match or mismatch)}, \\ H(i-1, j) + d, & \text{(deletion)}, \\ H(i, j-1) + d, & \text{(insertion)}, \end{cases}
$$

where:

- $S(a_i, b_j)$ is the score for matching $a_i$ and $b_j$ (e.g., $+2$ for match, $-1$ for mismatch).
- $d$ is the penalty for a gap (e.g., $-2$).

---

##### **Key Steps**

1. **Initialization**:

   - Set the first row and the first column to 0: $H(i, 0) = 0$ and $H(0, j) = 0$ for all $i, j$.
2. **Filling the Matrix**:

   - Compute the score for each cell $H(i, j)$ using the recurrence relation.
3. **Traceback**:

   - Find the cell with the **maximum value** in the matrix $H(i, j)$.
   - Trace back from this cell until you reach a cell with 0, collecting the optimal local alignment.
4. **Result**:

   - The score at the maximum value cell is the score of the optimal local alignment.
   - The corresponding path shows the aligned subsequences.

---

##### **Step-by-Step Example**

**Sequences**

- $A = \text{"GATTACA"}$
- $B = \text{"GCATGCU"}$

**Scoring Scheme**

- Match $S(a_i, b_j) = +2$
- Mismatch $S(a_i, b_j) = -1$
- Gap penalty $d = -2$

**1\. Initialize the Matrix**

We create an $8 \times 8$ matrix (since the lengths of $A$ and $B$ are 7 and 7, respectively), with the first row and column initialized to 0:

$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} & & G & C & A & T & G & C & U \\ \hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ G & 0 & & & & & & & \\ A & 0 & & & & & & & \\ T & 0 & & & & & & & \\ T & 0 & & & & & & & \\ A & 0 & & & & & & & \\ C & 0 & & & & & & & \\ A & 0 & & & & & & & \\ \end{array}$

---

**2\. Fill the Matrix**

We compute each cell $H(i, j)$ by comparing the three possible choices (match/mismatch, gap in $A$, or gap in $B$), always taking the maximum value (or 0 if negative):

**First few computations**:

- $H(1, 1) = \max(0, H(0, 0) + S(G, G), H(0, 1) + d, H(1, 0) + d) = \max(0, 0 + 2, 0 - 2, 0 - 2) = 2$
- $H(1, 2) = \max(0, H(0, 1) + S(G, C), H(0, 2) + d, H(1, 1) + d) = \max(0, 0 - 1, 0 - 2, 2 - 2) = 0$
- Repeat similarly for each $(i, j)$.

---

**3\. Final Matrix**

After filling the matrix, we get:

$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} & & G & C & A & T & G & C & U \\ \hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ G & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ A & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ T & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 2 & 0 \\ T & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\ A & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 3 & 1 & 0 \\ C & 0 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 1 \\ A & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ \end{array}$

---

**4\. Traceback**

- The maximum value in the matrix is **6** at position $(4, 4)$.
- We trace back to the first 0, yielding the aligned subsequences: $A = \text{"TACA"}$ $B = \text{"TACG"}$

---

**Conclusion**

The optimal local alignment score is **6**, corresponding to the aligned subsequences `"TAC"` (from both sequences) with the maximum local similarity.

#### 3.1.4 MSA(Multi-Sequence Alignment)

##### Definition

Given $m$ sequences $S_i, i = 1, \cdots, m$, the sequence set $S$ can be expressed as:

$$
S := \begin{cases}
S_1 = (S_{11}, S_{12}, \cdots, S_{1n_1}) \\
S_2 = (S_{21}, S_{22}, \cdots, S_{2n_2}) \\
\vdots \\
S_m = (S_{m1}, S_{m2}, \cdots, S_{mn_m}) \\
\end{cases}
$$

A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is generated from this set of sequences $S$ by inserting gaps (denoted by “-”) into each $S_i$ until all modified sequences $S_i'$ have the same length $L$ such that:

$$
L \geq \max \{ n_i \mid i = 1, \cdots, m \}
$$

Additionally, no column in the aligned sequence set $S'$ should contain only gaps.

The MSA form of the sequence set $S$ is represented as:

$$
S' := \begin{cases}
S_1' = (S_{11}', S_{12}', \cdots, S_{1L}') \\
S_2' = (S_{21}', S_{22}', \cdots, S_{2L}') \\
\vdots \\
S_m' = (S_{m1}', S_{m2}', \cdots, S_{mL}') \\
\end{cases}
$$

To recover the original sequences $S_i$ from $S_i'$, all gaps are removed.

---

##### Example of MSA using a multiseq algorithm

Input Sequences:

1. **Sequence 1**: `ACGTGCA`
2. **Sequence 2**: `ACTGGA`
3. **Sequence 3**: `ACGTC`

The sequences are aligned as follows with some MSA algorithm:

Sequence 1: ACGTGCA
Sequence 2: AC-TGGA
Sequence 3: ACGT-C-

### 3.2. **Structural Alignment**

Structural alignment involves aligning two or more 3D structures of biomolecules (typically proteins or RNA) to identify spatial correspondences that reveal similarities in their 3D conformations, despite potential differences in sequence.

Formally, given two biomolecular structures $P = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m) $ and $Q = (q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n)$, where $p_i $ and $q_j $ represent the 3D coordinates of atoms (e.g., $C\alpha$ atoms for proteins):

* A structural alignment is a mapping $f : \{1, 2, \ldots, m\} \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ that pairs residues $p_i$ and $q_{f(i)}$.
* The alignment maximizes the spatial superposition of aligned atoms or residues while minimizing a predefined geometric distance metric.

#### 3.2.2 RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation):

The quality of the structural alignment is typically quantified by the RMSD:

$$
\text{RMSD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \| p_i - q_{f(i)} \|^2 }
$$

where $k$ is the number of aligned pairs, and $\| \cdot \|$ denotes the Euclidean norm.

#### Scoring Function:

An optimal structural alignment maximizes the number of aligned residues or minimizes the RMSD under allowed structural distortions, including:

* **Rigid-body transformations** : Translation and rotation.
* **Flexible alignments** : Incorporate local structural flexibility (e.g., hinge motions).

Common algorithms for structural alignment include:

* **DALI** (Distance Alignment Matrix)
* **CE** (Combinatorial Extension)
* **TM-align** (Template Modeling Alignment).

#### **3.2.3 STAMP (Structural Alignment of Multiple Proteins)**

 **URL** : [https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/manuals/stamp.4.4/stamp.html](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/manuals/stamp.4.4/stamp.html)

[STAMP](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/software.html#3Dstructure) is a package for the alignment of protein sequences based on three-dimensional (3D) structure. It provides not only multiple alignments and the corresponding `best-fit’ superimpositions, but also a systematic and reproducible method for assessing the quality of such alignments. It also provides a method for protein 3D structure data base scanning. In addition to structure comparison, the STAMP package provides input for programs to display and analyse protein sequence alignments and tertiary structures.

## **4. Visualization Tools**

### **4.1 VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics)**

MD is designed for modeling, visualization, and analysis of biological systems such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure. VMD provides a wide variety of methods for rendering and coloring a molecule: simple points and lines, CPK spheres and cylinders, licorice bonds, backbone tubes and ribbons, cartoon drawings, and others. VMD can be used to animate and analyze the trajectory of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In particular, VMD can act as a graphical front end for an external MD program by displaying and animating a molecule undergoing simulation on a remote computer.

 **URL** : [https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd)

* **Purpose** : A molecular visualization program used for viewing molecular dynamics simulations.
* **Key Features** :
  * Reads `.pdb`, `.gro`, and simulation trajectory files.
  * Can display molecular surfaces, secondary structures, and molecular bonds.
* **Uses** :
  * Visualization of protein-ligand interactions.
  * Rendering of molecular movies for presentations.

### **4.2 MultiSeq (VMD Extension)**

MultiSeq (Roberts et al.,  *BMC Bioinformatics* ,  **7** :382, 2006) is a bioinformatics analysis environment developed in the Luthey-Schulten Group at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. MultiSeq allows users to organize, display, and analyze both sequence and structure data for proteins and nucleic acids, and has been incorporated in VMD as a plugin tool starting with VMD version 1.8.5. In this section you will learn how to compare protein structures and sequences with the VMD MultiSeq plugin.

#### Example

We will use the water transporting channel protein, aquaporin, as an example.

You can download the template pdb from:
