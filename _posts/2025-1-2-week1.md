### **1.2 SWISSPROT/UniprotKB**

 **URL** : [https://www.uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org/) (part of UniProt)

SWISS-PROT, now commonly referred to as the **Swiss-Prot** database, is a **manually curated** database of protein sequences that provides **high-quality annotations** about proteins. It forms a core part of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), which is one of the most widely used resources in proteomics and bioinformatics.

* **High-Quality, Reviewed Entries:**

  * Each protein entry in Swiss-Prot is reviewed manually by biocurators who verify the sequence and provide detailed functional annotations.
  * Annotations may include protein names, function, subcellular location, biological pathways, interactions, and post-translational modifications (PTMs).
* **Experimental Validation**:

  * Swiss-Prot prioritizes data derived from experimental evidence (e.g., mass spectrometry, crystallography) to ensure that the annotations are based on proven results rather than computational predictions alone.
* **Low Redundancy:**

  * Efforts are made to avoid duplicate entries, ensuring that only unique sequences with biologically relevant differences are stored.
* **Consistent Nomenclature and Controlled Vocabulary:**

  * Swiss-Prot ensures that protein names and descriptions are standardized and follow controlled vocabulary to avoid confusion.

#### **Relationship Between Swiss-Prot and UniProt**

## **2. Deep Learning Neural Networks (NN)**

### **2.1Neural Networks (NNs)** :

Deep learning architectures for biological sequence and structure analysis.

Typical layers:

* **Input Layer** : Takes biological sequence data (DNA/protein sequences).
* **Hidden Layers** : Perform computations using activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid).
* **Output Layer** : Predicts properties (e.g., structure, binding sites).

### **2.2Example Applications** :

#### **[AlphaFold3](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/)** : Predicts protein structures from sequences.

AlphaFold 3, developed by Isomorphic Labs Limited (London, United Kingdom) and Google DeepMind, represents a significant leap forward in the field of molecular biology through its ability to predict the structure and interactions of biomolecules with unparalleled accuracy. This revolutionary model extends its predictive capabilities beyond proteins to encompass a broad spectrum of biomolecules, **including proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands**, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the biological world.

* **The Evoformer in AF2/AF3** is based on a **transformer-like neural network** that takes in two main representations:

  1. **MSA Representation (multiple sequence alignment)** – captures evolutionary conservation patterns across homologous sequences.
  2. **Pair Representation (pairwise distances)** – models spatial relationships between amino acids in the sequence.

  The Evoformer learns how amino acids interact within a protein sequence and how these interactions evolve across homologous sequences by applying attention and mixing operations to the MSA and pair representations.
* **Diffusion Module(AF3 only):** AF3 utilizes a diffusion model to generate predicted protein structures by progressively refining a noisy initial representation of atomic coordinates= , essentially "denoising" the data to arrive at a final, accurate protein structure; it replaces the previous "Structure module" used in AlphaFold 2

![AF3](../assets/images/2025-1-2-week1/alphafold3.webp)

AF3 is pubicly available in the github repository: [google-deepmind/alphafold3: AlphaFold 3 inference pipeline.](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) The model parameters have to be requested from Google DeepMind by [this form](https://forms.gle/svvpY4u2jsHEwWYS6) and subject to [terms of use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).

## **3. Sequence/Structure Alignment Algorithms**

### 3.1. **Sequence Alignment**

Sequence alignment is the process of arranging the sequences of nucleotides (DNA or RNA) or amino acids (proteins) to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of structural, functional, or evolutionary relationships.

Formally, given two sequences $A = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m) $ and $B = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) $ over an alphabet (e.g., $\Sigma = \{A, C, G, T\}$ for nucleotides or 20 amino acids for proteins), a sequence alignment is a set of pairs of indices $(i, j) $ such that:

* Each index $i$ corresponds to a character in $A$, and $j$ corresponds to a character in $B$.
* Each character can appear in at most one pair in the alignment.
* The order is preserved: If $(i, j)$ and $(i', j')$ are pairs in the alignment and $i < i'$, then $j < j'$.

#### 3.1.1Scoring Function:

The alignment is evaluated based on a scoring function $S(A, B)$, which typically includes:

* $\delta(a_i, b_j)$: A substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM or PAM for proteins) that assigns a score to matching or mismatching pairs.
* $g(k)$: A gap penalty function that penalizes insertions or deletions in the sequence.

The optimal alignment maximizes the score:

$$
\text{Score} = \sum_{(i,j) \in \text{alignment}} \delta(a_i, b_j) - \sum_{\text{gaps}} g(k)
$$

Types of Sequence Alignments:

* **Global alignment** (e.g., Needleman-Wunsch): Aligns the entire length of both sequences.
* **Local alignment** (e.g., Smith-Waterman): Identifies the highest-scoring subsequences.

#### **3.1.2 Smith-Waterman Algorithm**

 **Purpose** : Performs local sequence alignment.

* **Characteristics** :
* Uses dynamic programming to find the best local alignment.
* Works with substitution matrices (e.g., BLOSUM, PAM) to score matches.
* Particularly useful for detecting conserved motifs within large sequences.

 **References** :

* Smith-Waterman (original publication): [DOI link](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(81)90087-5)

### 3.2. **Structural Alignment (Rigorous Definition)**

Structural alignment involves aligning two or more 3D structures of biomolecules (typically proteins or RNA) to identify spatial correspondences that reveal similarities in their 3D conformations, despite potential differences in sequence.

Formally, given two biomolecular structures $P = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m) $ and $Q = (q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n)$, where $p_i $ and $q_j $ represent the 3D coordinates of atoms (e.g., $C\alpha$ atoms for proteins):

* A structural alignment is a mapping $f : \{1, 2, \ldots, m\} \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ that pairs residues $p_i$ and $q_{f(i)}$.
* The alignment maximizes the spatial superposition of aligned atoms or residues while minimizing a predefined geometric distance metric.

#### 3.2.2 RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation):

The quality of the structural alignment is typically quantified by the RMSD:

$$
\text{RMSD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \| p_i - q_{f(i)} \|^2 }
$$

where $k$ is the number of aligned pairs, and $\| \cdot \|$ denotes the Euclidean norm.

#### Scoring Function:

An optimal structural alignment maximizes the number of aligned residues or minimizes the RMSD under allowed structural distortions, including:

* **Rigid-body transformations** : Translation and rotation.
* **Flexible alignments** : Incorporate local structural flexibility (e.g., hinge motions).

Common algorithms for structural alignment include:

* **DALI** (Distance Alignment Matrix)
* **CE** (Combinatorial Extension)
* **TM-align** (Template Modeling Alignment).

### **3.2 STAMP (Structural Alignment of Multiple Proteins)**

MD is designed for modeling, visualization, and analysis of biological systems such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure. VMD provides a wide variety of methods for rendering and coloring a molecule: simple points and lines, CPK spheres and cylinders, licorice bonds, backbone tubes and ribbons, cartoon drawings, and others. VMD can be used to animate and analyze the trajectory of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In particular, VMD can act as a graphical front end for an external MD program by displaying and animating a molecule undergoing simulation on a remote computer.

### **4.2 MultiSeq (VMD Extension)**

**Purpose** : MultiSeq (Roberts et al.,  *BMC Bioinformatics* ,  **7** :382, 2006) is a bioinformatics analysis environment developed in the Luthey-Schulten Group at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. MultiSeq allows users to organize, display, and analyze both sequence and structure data for proteins and nucleic acids, and has been incorporated in VMD as a plugin tool starting with VMD version 1.8.5.
