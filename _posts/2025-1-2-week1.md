### **1.2 SWISSPROT/UniprotKB**

 **URL** : [https://www.uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org/) (part of UniProt)

SWISS-PROT, now commonly referred to as the **Swiss-Prot** database, is a **manually curated** database of protein sequences that provides **high-quality annotations** about proteins. It forms a core part of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), which is one of the most widely used resources in proteomics and bioinformatics.

* **High-Quality, Reviewed Entries:**

  * Each protein entry in Swiss-Prot is reviewed manually by biocurators who verify the sequence and provide detailed functional annotations.
  * Annotations may include protein names, function, subcellular location, biological pathways, interactions, and post-translational modifications (PTMs).
* **Experimental Validation**:

  * Swiss-Prot prioritizes data derived from experimental evidence (e.g., mass spectrometry, crystallography) to ensure that the annotations are based on proven results rather than computational predictions alone.
* **Low Redundancy:**

  * Efforts are made to avoid duplicate entries, ensuring that only unique sequences with biologically relevant differences are stored.
* **Consistent Nomenclature and Controlled Vocabulary:**

  * Swiss-Prot ensures that protein names and descriptions are standardized and follow controlled vocabulary to avoid confusion.

#### **Relationship Between Swiss-Prot and UniProt**

**UniProt** (Universal Protein Resource) is a comprehensive database that consolidates multiple protein databases, including  **Swiss-Prot** , to provide a unified platform for protein sequence and functional information. UniProt consists of three major components:

### **1.3 PDB (Protein Data Bank)**

 **URL** : [https://www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/)

* **Purpose** : Repository of 3D structural data for biological macromolecules.
* **Key Features** :
  * Structures determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
  * Formats: `.pdb`, `.cif`, and `.mtz` files.
* **Applications** :
  * Structure-based drug design, protein-ligand interaction analysis, and homology modeling.

### **1.4 SCOP/SCOP2 (Structural Classification of Proteins)**

 **URL** : [http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk](http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)

* **Purpose** : Classifies proteins hierarchically based on structural and evolutionary relationships.
* How to Use: [SCOP| Structural Classification of Proteins](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/scop/about)
* **Hierarchy Levels** : Class → Fold → Superfamily → Family

  * Class: grouped based on their overall secondary structure composition.
    * all alpha
    * all beta
    * alpha/beta
    * alpha+beta
    * IUPR(Intrinsically Unstructured Protein Regions)
  * **Fold:** Groups superfamilies that share the same overall arrangement of secondary structures (architecture and topology)
    * Example: TIM-barrel (α/β-barrel)
  * Superfamily: A superfamily contains proteins that share structural features and likely have a common evolutionary ancestor
    * Example: **Globin superfamily** (hemoglobin, myoglobin).
  * Family: A **family** contains proteins that are **closely related** with  **high sequence similarity** .
    * These proteins often share a **common biological function** and can be identified using standard sequence alignment methods (e.g., BLAST).
    * Example: Serine protease family (trypsin, chymotrypsin).

#### Example: Hemoglobin Subunit

* **Class:** All-α proteins (predominantly α-helices).
  * **Fold:** Globin-like fold (8 α-helices arranged in a specific topology).
    * **Superfamily:** Globins (proteins involved in oxygen transport).
      * **Family:** Hemoglobin family (proteins with oxygen-binding functions).

### **1.5 CATH/GEN3D (Class, Architecture, Topology, Homologous Superfamily)**

 **URL** : [https://www.cathdb.info](https://www.cathdb.info/)

**CATH (Class, Architecture, Topology, Homology)** is a publicly available online database that classifies protein domains based on their three-dimensional structures and evolutionary relationships. It was created in the 1990s by **Professor Christine Orengo** and is maintained at  **University College London (UCL)** .

**Gene3D** complements CATH by predicting domains for proteins without experimentally determined structures using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

#### **Key Attributes** :

* Use domain-based classification for protein folds.
* Use for comparisons of protein architectures and homologous relationships.

## **2. Deep Learning Neural Networks (NN)**

### **Neural Networks (NNs)** :

Deep learning architectures for biological sequence and structure analysis.

Typical layers:

* **Input Layer** : Takes biological sequence data (DNA/protein sequences).
* **Hidden Layers** : Perform computations using activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid).
* **Output Layer** : Predicts properties (e.g., structure, binding sites).

### **Example Applications** :

#### **[AlphaFold3](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/)** : Predicts protein structures from sequences.

AlphaFold 3, developed by Isomorphic Labs Limited (London, United Kingdom) and Google DeepMind, represents a significant leap forward in the field of molecular biology through its ability to predict the structure and interactions of biomolecules with unparalleled accuracy. This revolutionary model extends its predictive capabilities beyond proteins to encompass a broad spectrum of biomolecules, **including proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands**, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the biological world.

* **The Evoformer in AF2/AF3** is based on a **transformer-like neural network** that takes in two main representations:

  1. **MSA Representation (multiple sequence alignment)** – captures evolutionary conservation patterns across homologous sequences.
  2. **Pair Representation (pairwise distances)** – models spatial relationships between amino acids in the sequence.

  The Evoformer learns how amino acids interact within a protein sequence and how these interactions evolve across homologous sequences by applying attention and mixing operations to the MSA and pair representations.
* **Diffusion Module(AF3 only):** AF3 utilizes a diffusion model to generate predicted protein structures by progressively refining a noisy initial representation of atomic coordinates= , essentially "denoising" the data to arrive at a final, accurate protein structure; it replaces the previous "Structure module" used in AlphaFold 2

![AF3](./image/2025-1-2-week1/alphafold3.webp)

AF3 is pubicly available in the github repository: [google-deepmind/alphafold3: AlphaFold 3 inference pipeline.](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) The model parameters have to be requested from Google DeepMind by [this form](https://forms.gle/svvpY4u2jsHEwWYS6) and subject to [terms of use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).

### **RoseTTAFold**

RoseTTAFold is a protein structure prediction tool developed by the Baker Lab, leveraging a three-track neural network that integrates 1D sequence information, 2D distance maps, and 3D structural coordinates simultaneously. This architecture allows for iterative refinement of protein structures and has demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting single-chain folds, multi-domain proteins, and protein-protein complexes. By combining sequence and structure data at different levels, RoseTTAFold aids experimental methods like X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, making it a valuable tool for solving previously intractable structural problems.

#### **DeepSEA** : Predicts regulatory effects of genomic variants.

DeepSEA is a deep learning-based framework designed to predict the chromatin effects of sequence alterations at single-nucleotide resolution. It can accurately infer the epigenetic state of a sequence, including transcription factor binding, DNase I hypersensitivity, and histone modifications across various cell types. This predictive capability allows DeepSEA to assess the chromatin impact of sequence variants and prioritize regulatory variants for further analysis.
